Mobile Presence Framework

This tool is designed to support an institution's mobile presence. It
does not in itself provide services to mobile devices; it provides a
way to track various services and group them into packages. A package
is a collections of services related by the intended audience. A given
service may be in multiple packages, and a given package may have
multiple services. The MPF manages packages and services, allowing for
easy addition/removal of services and packages, and automatically
generating appropriate nav frameworks for each given package.

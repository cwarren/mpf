TODO

CURRENT

change process RSS to be 10 or 15 min intervals instead of 1 hour

tweak list item icon positions
    - for package show, 29x icons are not centered vertically and need a larger right margin (NOTE: this might be a problem for Kate to tackle)

implement show for individual services


implement cron-ed home page instantiation
    - add home page instantiation to deploy script


look into why the arts llfeed isn't working correctly (showing 'all' instead - possibly a caching thing?)
    - confirm what should be included in 'arts': performances and exhibits?
    - confirm what should be included in 'public': lectures/talks... and performances?
    

admin/service_package/edit/
    - available service packages aren't showing the package background (img/package.PNG is not loading)
        + name wrong?
        + location wrong?
        
add google tracking code


re-examine RSS handling
NOTE: this is rendered unnecessary by static page instantiation!
    - move feed maintenance to a daemon process (see https://github.com/ssoroka/scheduler_daemon)
        + NOTE: hopefully this will provide enough speed boost that the below options aren't necessary... but will 
        probably need more speed
            * consider caching generated HTML to allow skipping of parsing step during live use; would need to 
            refactor to centralize the HTML generating code somehow so it's accessible to daemon as well as main
            (main still needs it for robustness)
    - less desirable: do NOT pre-load RSS feeds
        + option 1: stage them to be loaded post-page-load via JS (if possible - iOS didn't play well with that before)
        + option 2: load them only when demanded
        + NOTE: not sure either will work with JS; i.e. post-load DOM manip often plays merry hell with JS event listeners


allow header images for packages
    - create table fields
    - display it if it exists
        + handle sizing for tablets

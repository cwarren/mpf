show/*
    - 16x icons are too large - they're not centered vertically (NOTE: this might be a problem for Kate to tackle)

admin/service_package/edit/
    - available service packages aren't showing the package packground (img/package.PNG is not loading)
        + name wrong?
        + location wrong?

re-examine RSS handling
    - move feed maintenance to a daemon process (see https://github.com/ssoroka/scheduler_daemon)
        + NOTE: hopefully this will provide enough speed boost that the below options aren't necessary... but will 
        probably need more speed
            * consider caching generated HTML to allow skipping of parsing step during live use; would need to 
            refactor to centralize the HTML generating code somehow so it's accessible to daemon as well as main
            (main still needs it for robustness)
    - less desirable: do NOT pre-load RSS feeds
        + option 1: stage them to be loaded post-page-load via JS (if possible - iOS didn't play well with that before)
        + option 2: load them only when demanded
        + NOTE: not sure either will work with JS; i.e. post-load DOM manip often plays merry hell with JS event listeners

allow header images for packages
    - create table fields
    - display it if it exists
        + handle sizing for tablets

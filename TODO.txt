TODO

- in edit service package, make the service chooser stuff affect the db, not just the screen
  + fun ajax-y stuff for service packages
  + adding and removing services from a package
    * implement add_service and remove_service methods on the controller
      # OR... consider doing a full update (though that could be slow...)
    * add approp routes
      # figure out why rake routes fails! (and depr warning stuff)

- on service package edit page, show packages that include this service
  + link to edit for each package
  + option to remove from all packages
